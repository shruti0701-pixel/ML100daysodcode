# Seaborn:

1. Scatter Plot: Shows how two numeric variables relate to each other. Imagine a bunch of dots, where the position of each dot shows the value of two things you're comparing.

2. Box Plot: Summarizes how a bunch of numbers are spread out. It's like a box with whiskers:
* Box: Represents the middle 50% of the data.
* Center line: Shows the median (middle number).
* Whiskers: Extend outwards, showing the range of most data points.
* Outliers: Points way outside the whiskers are shown separately.

3. Violin Plot: Similar to a boxplot, but also shows the distribution of the data within the box. Imagine a violin leaning on its side, wider where there are more data points.

4. KDE Plot (Kernel Density Estimation): Shows the probability density of a numeric variable. Think of it as a smooth curve showing how often different values appear in your data.

5. Distribution Plot (Histogram): Shows how frequent different values are in your data. Imagine bars next to each other, where the height of each bar shows how many data points fall within that range.

6. Bar Plot: Compares categories using bars. The height (or length) of each bar represents the value for that category.

7. Count Plot: Similar to a bar plot, but shows the number of occurrences for each category.

8. Heatmap: Shows relationships between many categories using color intensity. Imagine a grid where the color intensity in each square represents the value at that intersection of categories.

9. Pair Plot: A grid of scatter plots, showing how all pairs of variables in your data relate to each other. Like a bunch of two-way conversations between your data points!
